# Diceware
Diceware Passphrase Generator with GUI

## Introduction
Diceware is a technique that uses dice to generate a random number that is 5 digits long. The 5 numbers, between 11111 and 7776, is then used to look up a word according to that word's index. Multiple words are then combined to produce a passphrase, with a recommended length of 6 words. See http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html for more information.

The diceware method was developed by Arnold G. Reinhold, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Copyright Â© 1995-2015
